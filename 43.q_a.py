# #  Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?

#  Pythonâ€™s zip() function is defined as zip(*iterables).
#     The function takes in iterables as arguments and returns an iterator. 
#     This iterator generates a series of tuples containing elements from each iterable. 
#     zip() can accept any type of iterable, such as files, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and so on.
